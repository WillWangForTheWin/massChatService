Creative Portion:
1.We created the feature where all users are able to see the total number of members in a specific group chat. This is very useful because all users can see what is the population in each group and this allows users to know which group has more people and directs them to join the correct one they are looking for. For example, we might have two groups with the same group name, but with very different population. So, with the number of members shown, it makes the identification of the right group much easier.
2.we have a feature that allows the group leader to pass the rights of kicking people out to other member in the group. This is vital as it allows democracy in the group and makes every member feels empowered as they can determine who to keep and who to remove. Thus, this makes the chat group more personalized and comes in handy in an actual work setting.
3.We have a feature to allow everyone already in the group to invite outsiders to join. This is important as sometimes new users do not know what the new groupâ€™s name is and they might join the wrong group. Also, by extending invitation, we showed hospitality to our new member, which is crucial is some real-life chat group situations. We believe this feature is very practical and it will be adopted by many other commercialized real Apps in the social media arena.
